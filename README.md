## General info
As part of my 100 Days of Code challenge I have been tasked with creating a Mixed Messages generator by the Codecadamy school and was allowed to take the prject in a direction of my choosing.
In the midst of this pandemic, and the regular lockdowns, mental health in the UK is at an all time low and when you feel yourself in a mental slump you can not always think of ways to pick your mood back up. MOOST is a simple Mood Boosting tool to randomly suggest an activity to pull you out of your mental slump.
